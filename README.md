# Deep-learning-in-company-bankruptcy-prediction  
• Constructed Ensemble Modelling of XGboosting, SVM to achieve an f1-score of 95%  
• Constructed weighted/cost-sensitive neural networks to account for the impact on biased cases  
• Leveraged Keras in TensorFlow to optimize hyperparameters for hidden layers of neural network  
  
This project uses a gold medal dataset called Company Bankruptcy Prediction from Kaggle.com with the
usability score equal to 10. The Taiwan Economic Journal gathered these data from 1999 to 2009. Also, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange is involved to define company bankruptcy.
The dataset contains 6819 entries. Each entry has 96 attributes, which are conventional accounting ratios to
demostrate a company's financial stability.
In this coursework, we are going to explore the characteristics of bankruptcy company, and use applied machine
learning to predict companies bankruptcy. We are going to analyse the dataset in the following steps:
Firstly, we will clean the dataset and go through Basic analysis to have a basic knowledge of the dataset.
Secondly, we will use 7 differences machine learning classifiers to predict the company bankruptcy. And then try
to find a good model.
Finally, to improve the predictiotion, we will use 3 Deep learning models to predict the company bankruptcy. And
then try to find a best model among our results.
